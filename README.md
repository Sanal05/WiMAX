Working on making the WiMAX scheduling better than the previous.Trying to give time to BE too and not make it starve or drop easily.
We are  trying to make all request getting fullfilled.
This improvement is because we know most of the request a station gets is of lower classes and very few requests from upper classes,so dropping lower class request all the time is not a good idea.
So,we are developing an algorithm so that all the requests are handled.
